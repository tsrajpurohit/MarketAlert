            "description": "On a year-on-year basis, the sample's revenue increased by 8.7% in FY24, slower than the 22% growth in the previous year, reflecting demand weakness. Net profit, on the other hand, shot up by 30% to Rs 14.2 lakh crore due to softer input costs and stable interest outgo relative to the operating profit (EBIT). Net margin improved to 8.7% compared with 7.3% in the previous year and 4.9% five years ago.",
