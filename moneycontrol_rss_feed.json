The index sustained above the bearish gap of February 28 for another session with above-average volumes, indicating positivity, though there was some profit-taking at higher levels. Hence, according to experts, as long as the index holds 22,500 in the upcoming sessions, an upward journey toward the 22,750-22,800 zone is possible. However, if it falls below 22,500, the support is placed at 22,300. This will be an important week for the Nifty as it would determine whether the trend would be on the upside or downside after last week\u2019s upmove. IndusInd Bank, Sun Pharma are among the stocks to watch out for today.
