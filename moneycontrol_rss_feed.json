The Nifty 50 closed above 26,000 for the first time, though broader markets struggled. Observers are now questioning whether this uptrend can continue. Experts suggest that Nifty 50's new resistance level is set at 26,200, with immediate support at 25,800. However, with the monthly F&O expiry approaching, increased volatility is expected. This morning global cues are mixed, with the US markets ending mixed overnight, while Asia-Pacific markets opened higher this morning. Among stocks in focus, watch out for PB Fintech, Vedanta, Five-Star Business Finance, among others.
