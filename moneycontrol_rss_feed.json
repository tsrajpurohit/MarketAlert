            "description": "Last week, Sensex and Nifty managed to nearly gain 1 percent. Markets also started the December series on a positive note. However, the Q2 GDP numbers came below Street estimates, so any recovery would be keenly watched out by market participants. Experts now eye Nifty to see an immediate resistance of 24,350 with support placed around 23,900. This week, RBI MPC policy meeting, FII flows, global cues, among others will dictate market trends. This morning, global cues were mixed. US markets ended higher on Friday, with Dow Jones and the S&P 500 notching new closing highs. Asia-Pacific markets, meanwhile, were mixed this morning as traders look to a data packed week.  Among stocks in focus, watch out for Auto stocks, Cipla, and Home First Finance.
