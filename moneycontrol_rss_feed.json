            "description": "The Nifty 50 rallied 170 points, breaking its lower-high, lower-low pattern after Monday\u2019s pause. Bulls drew strength from supportive technical and momentum signals. Experts say a decisive close above 25,250, tested intraday on Tuesday, could pave the way for 25,400\u201325,550 in the coming sessions. Dips are likely to attract buyers, with immediate support at 25,150 and a key zone at 25,000\u201324,850.\n\nGlobal cues are mixed this morning, but GIFT Nifty signals a positive start as markets await the US Fed\u2019s rate decision. Jindal Steel will be in focus after submitting a non-binding offer to acquire Thyssenkrupp\u2019s German steel unit. Meanwhile, trade talks between India and the US have resumed, and US President Donald Trump became the first world leader to wish Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his 75th birthday.",
