            "description": "Nifty extended its losing streak for the fifth straight session, slipping 166 points to fall below the 24,900 mark. Except for Nifty Metal, all indices ended in the red, with Realty, IT, Auto and Pharma stocks facing selling pressure, while the broader markets also witnessed profit-booking for the fourth day in a row. This morning, global cues were negative. US markets edged lower overnight for the third straight session after President Donald Trump imposed 100 percent duty on imported branded or patented pharma products unless made in US. Asia-Pacific markets also inched lower this morning following weak Wall Street cues.
