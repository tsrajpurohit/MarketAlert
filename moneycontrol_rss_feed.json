            "description": "The Nifty 50 slipped 0.2% on January 13, giving up a part of the previous session\u2019s gains. While the index negated the lower high\u2013lower low pattern seen over the past five sessions, it continues to trade below its short- and medium-term moving averages, with momentum indicators still signalling caution. Experts believe the market is likely to remain in a consolidation phase unless the Nifty decisively breaks above the 25,900\u201326,000 resistance zone. A sustained move above this level could open the door for a rally toward 26,200\u201326,300, while on the downside, immediate support is seen at 25,600, followed by a key level at 25,450. Globally, Wall Street retreated from record highs, with the S&P 500 drifting lower, weighed down by banking stocks. Asian markets opened mixed, though Japan\u2019s Nikkei scaled a fresh record, crossing the 54,000 mark for the first time. Back home, GIFT Nifty signals a sluggish start for Dalal Street. In commodities, crude oil surged to a 12-week high amid escalating geopolitical risks and supply disruption concerns. Gold and silver touched fresh record highs, as U.S. inflation data strengthened expectations of future Federal Reserve rate cuts. On the earnings front, IT major Infosys is set to report its Q3 results today. All eyes will be on guidance. Also watch out for Groww as it reports earnings today.
