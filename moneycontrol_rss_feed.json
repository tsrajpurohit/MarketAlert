            "description": "Indian equity market failed to sustain intraday gains with the Nifty ending below the 24,500 yet again. It was a third straight day of losses for the market. The index remained well below the 20-week EMA (24,550) and the 20-week SMA (24,700), which are key hurdles on the higher side. As long as it trades below these levels, consolidation may continue, with immediate support at the 24,400-24,350 zone. If the index breaks this support area, levels of 24,200-24,000 can't be ruled out in the upcoming sessions, experts said. This morning global cues are subdued and GIFT Nifty is hinting at a flat start. Watch out for HUL post disappointing volume growth in the second quarter. Among key earnings today are ITC, IndusInd Bank, NTPC.

The Street seems to be extrapolating near-term merger hiccups to future years.Given the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s track record and execution capabilities, HDFC Bank can positively surprise the Street on earnings growth albeit in the next fiscal which can lead to a valuation re-rating and stock upside.
