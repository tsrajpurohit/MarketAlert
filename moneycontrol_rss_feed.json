            "description": "Nifty staged a sharp rally in the last 45 minutes of trade, gaining 61 points to close above the 25,500 mark, lifted by financial heavyweights that also boosted Bank Nifty. However, the broader markets underperformed, with the Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices ending flat to slightly in the red. Among sectors, Nifty Realty and Private Banks emerged as the top gainers, while Pharma and Consumer Durables were the major losers of the session. This morning, global cues were mixed. US markets ended flat as investors assessed a slew of tariff announcements. Asia-Pacific markets also opened mixed this morning as Trump announced 50 percent duty on copper imports and warned of pharma import tariffs to go up to 200 percent.
