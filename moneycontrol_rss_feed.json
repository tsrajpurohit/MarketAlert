            "description": "Nifty extended its losing streak for the fifth straight session, slipping 166 points to fall below the 24,900 mark.

US markets edged lower overnight for the third straight session after President Donald Trump imposed 100 percent duty on imported branded or patented pharma products unless made in US. Asia-Pacific markets also inched lower this morning following weak Wall Street cues.
