            "link": "https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/videos/business/markets/will-nifty-end-7-day-losing-streak-as-trump-modi-meet-amid-reciprocal-tariff-move-opening-bell-12940580.html",
            "description": "The Nifty failed to sustain its intraday rally due to a lack of strength at higher levels but the Nifty managed to close above the 23,000 mark. This morning Asian markets are largely higher and the GIFT Nifty is signalling a positive start. Overnight Wall Street saw a rally even as US President Donald Trump inked plans for sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs\" on both allies and competitors in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war.But these tariffs will not come into effect immediately. Meanwhile, in his meeting with PM Modi, Trump said he plans to firm up some wonderful trade deals for India and the US. The two leaders discussed trade relations, immigration, military sales, nuclear technology among other key issues. Among stocks in focus today will be Hindalco and Manappuram Finance.
