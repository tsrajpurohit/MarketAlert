            "description": "The Nifty 50 showed a smart recovery of nearly 200 points from the day's low and closed with a moderate loss of 34 points on June 2, while defending the 24,700 levels on a closing basis, which is a positive sign. The index remains within the range of 24,500\u201325,000. According to experts, it is expected to remain choppy in the upcoming sessions. If the index decisively breaks below the lower range, the 24,380 level is one to watch. However, in case of a rebound, 24,900 is expected to act as a hurdle for the index. Global cues are positive this morning despite renewed trade tensions between US and China. The GIFT Nifty is hinting at a strong start for the Indian market. Aptus Value, Grasim, Adani Group stocks will be in focus today.
