            "description": "The unstoppable record run continues for benchmark indices! Sensex mounted on 85,900-mark for the first time and Nifty touched 26,250 on the monthly F&O expiry day. However, broader markets continued to languish, with midcaps trailing for the second straight day. Market observers are debating whether this uptrend can sustain in the near-term as well as focus will soon shift towards India Inc's second quarterly earnings. Accenture's increase revenue guidance for FY25 is likely to set a positive tone for technology stocks. Experts suggest that Nifty 50's new resistance level is set at 26,300, with immediate support at 26,000. This morning global cues are fairly strong. Wall Street clocked a strong close overnight, with S&P 500 ending on a record note and NASDAQ Composite extending gains to fourth day. Asia Pacific markets also rose this morning as China's stimulus measures take effect. Among stocks in focus, watch out for IT counters, Biocon, Nuvama Wealth, among others. Meanwhile, NSE index rejig is set to take place, with BEL and Trent set to enter Nifty 50, replacing Divi's Lab and LTIMindtree.
