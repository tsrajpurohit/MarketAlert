            "description": "Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty fell over 1 percent from day's highs and settled lower in the last session. On this final day of 2024, Nifty has already gained over 8 percent and is poised to end this year on a positive note, marking ninth consecutive year of good returns. Broader indices, on the other hand, have outperformed benchmarks this year. Today, the Street is eyeing Nifty's resistance at 23,900, with support placed around 23,500. This morning, global cues were mixed. US markets ended lower overnight, with headline indices down 1 percent each. Asia-Pacific markets also traded mixed this morning as investors digested China's manufacturing data. Among stocks in focus, watch out for ITC, Hindalco, and RVNL.
