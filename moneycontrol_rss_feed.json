            "description": "The Nifty 50 decisively broke above 24,850 supported by higher trading volume compared to the previous day, following a positive start on May 26. The index closed 0.6% higher, marking its second consecutive session of gains. Going forward, the index may enter a consolidation phase with strong support in the 24,850\u201324,900 range. A breakdown below this level could lead to increased selling pressure. However, as long as this support holds, the index is likely to continue its upward move toward the 25,200\u201325,300 zone. A decisive break above this resistance could spark a sharp rally, experts suggest. Watch out for IndiGo, PG Electroplast, Aurobindo Pharma and Nazara Tech in trade. Catch Nandita Khemka in conversation with Ajit Mishra, SVP-Technical Research, Religare Broking and , market expert Anshul Saigal.",
