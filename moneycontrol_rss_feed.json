            "description": "The Nifty 50 failed to hold on to follow-up buying on September 2, slipping 176 points from the day\u2019s high to close 0.2 percent lower. The index was unable to sustain above the midline of the Bollinger Bands, tempering sentiment after Monday\u2019s rebound. Analysts expect rangebound trade to persist until the benchmark climbs back above all key moving averages. On the downside, 24,400 is seen as immediate support, with 24,300\u201324,250 forming a crucial base. On the upside, resistance is pegged at 24,700\u201324,800, with 25,000 remaining a major hurdle. Meanwhile, the two-day GST Council meeting begins today, where the Centre\u2019s proposal for a two-rate structure will be discussed. FMCG, Autos will continue to be in focus.\n\nStocks in news include TCS, Waaree Energies, and Eternal. Tune in as Nandita Khemka speaks with Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, Assistant Vice President \u2013 Research & Advisory at Master Capital Services, and Puneet Sharma, CEO and Fund Manager at Whitespace Alpha.",
