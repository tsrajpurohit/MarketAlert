            "description": "City gas, once a highly promising sector with a clear edge over traditional fuels due to its pricing advantages, has now become one of the most challenging spaces. The government has slashed supplies of cheaper domestically produced natural gas to CNG retailers for the second time since October. Back then, supplies were cut by over 20%, and now, another 20% reduction has been implemented. This shift will significantly increase the raw material costs for city gas distributors. This would take a toll on earnings and squeeze margins for companies like IGL & MGL. Are these just short-term challenges or will this have a long-term impact? Should you invest in these stocks or avoid them completely? Watch this video to know more",
