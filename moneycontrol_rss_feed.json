            "description": "The Nifty 50 had a rangebound session again amid tariff-led uncertainty, possibly waiting for a trigger related to tariffs to gain firm direction. The index closed 0.6 percent lower on April 9 after the RBI policy. The VIX remained above the 20 mark. However, Trump\u2019s decision later in the day on Wednesday to pause reciprocal tariffs for 90 days for all trade partners, barring China (which attracts a 125% tariff rate), raised hopes for an upward change in market trend, according to experts. Technically, on the higher side, the index may face a hurdle at 22,850, followed by the 23,200-23,400 area; above this, the bulls may gain strength. However, support is placed at the 22,250-22,000 zone. TCS reported weak set of numbers for Q4. We decode the numbers with Omkar Tanksale, Senior Research Analyst - IT, Axis Securities. Also catch Nandita Khemka in conversation with Raja Venkatraman, Co-Founder, NeoTrader and market expert Ajay Bagga.",
