            "description": "The Nifty 50 extended its losing streak to a seventh straight session on September 29, closing modestly lower after a volatile day ahead of the September 30 F&O expiry. While bearish sentiment dominated, experts see room for consolidation before the next decisive move. Key levels to watch are immediate support at 24,600, followed by 24,500 and 24,400 (200-day EMA), with resistance placed around 24,800\u201324,900. InterGlobe Aviation and Max Healthcare enter the Nifty 50 index from today, replacing Hero MotoCorp and IndusInd Bank. New listings debuting today include Anand Rathi, Seshaasai Technologies, and Solarworld Energy Solutions, while stocks such as BEL, IRFC, and Globus Spirits remain in focus.
