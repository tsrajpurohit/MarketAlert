On Wednesday, the index gained 0.4%, closing above 25,250 and extending its higher-high, higher-low pattern, backed by bullish momentum indicators. Experts see room for the Nifty to reclaim 25,550 and possibly retest the year\u2019s high of 25,669, as long as it holds the key support zone of 25,150\u201325,000. A break below that range could trigger profit-taking. Cohance Lifesciences, Bajaj Finserv and Indolasr are among the stocks to watch out for today.
