Even in the last session, investors wealth was wiped out by a whopping Rs 20 lakh crore. This week, markets will react to India's GDP data, which has come in-line with Street estimates and has recovered from seven quarter lows. Auto sales figures, FII flows, US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, among others will also decide market trends. This morning, global cues were largely strong. US markets ended higher on Friday and US futures also edged up overnight. Meanwhile, Asian markets also started the day on a positive note despite uncertainity on US President Donald Trump's tariff plans. Among stocks, watch out for auto names, Voltas, and Ujjivan Small Finance Bank in today's trading session.
