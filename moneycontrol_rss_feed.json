            "description": "Indian benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty, tumbled over 1% on December 19, marking their fourth consecutive session of decline, as global market weakness weighed heavily on investor sentiment. The downturn followed the US Federal Reserve\u2019s cautious outlook on rate cuts, which dampened optimism. The Fed now forecasts only two rate cuts in 2025, down from its previous projection of four, a revision that unsettled markets worldwide. At the close of trading, the Sensex dropped 1.2%, shedding 964 points to settle at 79,218, while the Nifty fell 1.02%, losing 247.6 points to end at 23,951.25. In the broader market, the BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices saw modest declines of 0.3% each. This morning global cues are mixed with Dow snapping its 10-day losing streak and the GIFT Nifty indicating another weak open for our markets. IT stocks will be in focus post Accenture\u2019s results.
