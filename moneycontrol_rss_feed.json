The Nifty 50 may continue to face hurdles in the 25,200-25,250 zone on the higher side; above this level, a strong rally can't be ruled out. Until then, consolidation is expected to continue, with immediate support at 25,000, followed by 24,900, according to experts. This morning global cues are negative and GIFT Nifty is hinting at lower start for the Nify. Among stocks to watch will be Bajaj Auto, Mphasis, L&T Tech and Cochin Shipyard.
