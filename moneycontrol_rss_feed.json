Axis Bank, Wipro, Eicher Motors, ICICI Bank, Shriram Finance were among the top gainers on the Nifty, while losers included Infosys, Britannia Industries, Nestle India, HUL and Asian Paints. Among sectors, bank and metal rose more than 1 percent each, while IT index was down more than 1 percent and FMCG index was down 0.5 percent. BSE smallcap indices ended in the red, while Midcap index ended marginally higher. Markets, however, saw weekly losses for 3rd straight week, longest losing streak of 2024. This morning global cues are mixed to positive with the GIFT Nifty signalling a positive start.
