            "description": "Indian market is poised for a weak open as US bombs three nuclear sites at Iran. Dow Futures are lower, Asian markets are trading with cuts while the GIFT Nifty is hinting at a weak start for the Indian market. Meanwhile, On Friday the Nifty 50 gained solid strength after a three-day consolidation and rallied 1.29 percent, reviving weak sentiment alongside a falling VIX. Despite the recovery, the index remains within the broad range of 24,450\u201325,200 for several weeks now. As long as the index trades below 25,200, and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East\u2014which influence oil prices\u2014persist, consolidation and mild correction within a range-bound setup may continue. Key support levels remain at 24,700, followed by the 24,500\u201324,450 zone. A fall below this crucial support zone may trigger a forceful attack from bears, while a decisive and sustainable close above 25,200 can open the door for strong bullish action.
