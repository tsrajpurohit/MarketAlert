            "description": "Indian equity market failed to sustain intraday gains with the Nifty ending below the 24,500 yet again. It was a third straight day of losses for the market. The index remained well below the 20-week EMA (24,550) and the 20-week SMA (24,700), which are key hurdles on the higher side. As long as it trades below these levels, consolidation may continue, with immediate support at the 24,400-24,350 zone. If the index breaks this support area, levels of 24,200-24,000 can't be ruled out in the upcoming sessions, experts said. This morning global cues are subdued and GIFT Nifty is hinting at a flat start. Watch out for HUL post disappointing volume growth in the second quarter. Among key earnings today are ITC, IndusInd Bank, NTPC.
