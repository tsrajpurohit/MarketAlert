            "description": "After showing smart recovery in the previous session, Indian equity market remained under pressure on amid selling across the sectors barring auto. At close, the Sensex was down 73.48 points or 0.09 % at 81,151.27, and the Nifty was down 112.50 points or 0.45% at 24,741.50. On the back of positive global cues, the Indian indices opened on a strong note but erased all the gain in the initial hour and traded flat in the first half. However, the market witnessed extreme volatility in the second half, to close in the red with Nifty below 24,750.\n\nBiggest Nifty losers were Tata Consumer Products, Kotak Mahindra Bank, BPCL, IndusInd Bank and Bajaj Finserv, while gainers included HDFC Bank, Bajaj Auto, Asian Paints, M&M and Eicher Motors. Except auto, all other sectoral indices ended in the red with FMCG, metal, capital goods, power, realty, IT, oil & gas and media down 1-3%. Key earnings today include Bajaj Finance, Zomato & Paytm.
