            "description": "The market is set to wrap up a lackluster and uneventful week, with the Nifty stuck within a tight 300-point range. Bulls have battled fiercely to hold the 22,800 level, but any attempts to push beyond 23,000 have lacked conviction, making it clear that momentum remains elusive. Experts now see Nifty\u2019s immediate target at 23,000, with a potential move toward 23,200 if momentum picks up. However, failure to hold above 23,000 could prolong the consolidation phase, with crucial support resting at 22,700. This morning, global cues were largely lower. US markets saw selloff overnight due to weak forecast from Walmart. Asian markets too opened lower as investors digested Japanese hot inflation data for January. Among stocks, watch out for NTPC Green, Tata Steel, and HG Infra in today's trading session.
