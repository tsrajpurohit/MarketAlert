            "description": "The Nifty kicked off the week on a strong note, reclaiming the 25,000 mark led by financial stocks. The surge came even as a busy IPO calendar failed to dampen market sentiment. Among key movers, TCS gained 3 percent ahead of its quarterly results, while the Bank Nifty extended its winning streak, adding 1,800 points over the last five sessions. In the broader market, Trent and Bank of India will be in focus after their latest business updates. On the primary market front, the LG IPO opens for subscription today, while Tata Capital\u2019s issue was subscribed 39 percent on Day 1. This morning, global cues were mixed. US markets ended on a strong note, with S&P 500 and NASDAQ at fresh records following AI-Chip deal between AMD and OpenAI. Meanwhile, Asian markets were mixed, with gains being led by Japanese markets.
