            "description": "The significant selling pressure in the market continued, with the Nifty 50 losing more than one percent for the second consecutive session on November 13. This was driven by nervousness in global markets and a spike in CPI inflation. The index formed a long bearish candlestick once again and eventually hit the 200-day EMA support at 23,540. If the index decisively falls below this level, it may reach the second target (around 23,200) of the Head and Shoulders pattern in the upcoming sessions. However, on the upside, the levels to watch are 23,900-24,000, experts said. Also watch out for stocks like DMart, Zomato, Hero Moto among others. Catch Nandita Khemka in conversation with big market experts on how to navigate this selloff. Kunal Rambhia, Fund Manager, The Streets decodes the chart setup while Ajay Srivastav, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Finance Services and Mahesh Patil, CIO, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC share their market insights.",
