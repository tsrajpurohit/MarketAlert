All sectors popped in green, with auto, metal, and energy stocks leading majority of the gains. The optimism came on the back of soft US inflation print, which was at a 3-year low of 2.5 percent in August, clearing the way for Federal Reserve to start its rate easing cycle from next week. Swap markets are pricing in about 85 percent change of a 25 basis point rate cut in the September 18 meeting, significantly up from 60 percent a week ago, showed CME-FedWatch tool. This morning global cues are mixed with Wall Street clocking a 4th straight day of gains and Asian markets edging lower in early trade. The GIFT Nifty is hinting at a positive start for our markets.
