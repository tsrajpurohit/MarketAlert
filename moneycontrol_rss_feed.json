            "description": "Nifty slipped below 23,300 in a rangebound session after US President Donald Trump announced \"discounted\" 27 percent reciprocal tariffs on India, while broader markets outperformed benchmarks. As pharmaceutical products were exempted from any tariffs, Nifty Pharma index emerged as the top sectoral winner in yesterday's trade, followed by PSU Bank index. Conversely, IT, auto, and metal stocks saw significant losses amidst varied tariff measures. This morning, global cues were sharply lower. US markets suffered worst single-day drop overnight in 5 years, while Asian markets also started the day on a negative note. Among stocks, watch out for HDFC Bank, Mazagaon Dock, and Avenue Supermarts in today's trading session.
