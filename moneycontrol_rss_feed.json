            "description": "Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty clocked biggest single day losses in a month in the previous session, weighed by index heavyweights. Factors such as tight fight in the US Presidential elections, Fed's interest rate decision, more Chinese stimulus measures on the horizon kept market mood in check. With Nifty nearly 9 percent down from record highs, experts expect the index to face resistance at 24,200, with support placed around 23,500. This morning global cues are mixed, with Wall Street ending overnight on a weak note. Asia-Pacific markets, meanwhile, were mixed this morning. Among stocks in focus, watch out for Dr Reddy's, Titan, and Raymond India.
