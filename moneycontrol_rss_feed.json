The selloff was widespread, though the Nifty Realty index emerged as a rare exception, while sectors like Nifty Auto and Realty bore the brunt. Relief could be on the horizon on October 1, following SEBI's board meeting, which opted to keep changes in the F&O segment on hold. New developments included the introduction of MF Lite, expanded scope for the T+0 settlement cycle, the launch of a new asset class, among others. Looking ahead, market experts anticipate consolidation in upcoming sessions, as investors reallocate their portfolios ahead of Q2 results. Nifty is expected to face resistance at 26,000, with support around 25,500. This morning global cues are mixed. US indices ended at record highs, while Japan's Nikkei 225 rebounded 1% after seeing a sharp 4% fall yesterday, while Australian markets retreated from all-time highs. Meanwhile, escalating tensions in the Middle East cast a shadow on oil prices. Among stocks in focus, watch out for Tata Power, Mankind Pharma, NTPC, among others.
