            "description": "Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended their bull run to fifth straight day supported by gains in financial and technology stocks. Both the benchmarks gained 1 percent each in a highly volatile session, with Nifty ending above 24,700 on its weekly expiry day. Experts now eye Nifty to mount above 25,000 mark, with support placed around 24,350. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will deliver its policy outcome, with Street expecting no change in repo rates but some liquidity measures could be on the anvil to support growth. This morning, global cues were mixed. US markets retreated from their record highs, while Asia-Pacific markets were mixed. Among stocks in focus, watch out for Rate sensitive stocks, Dr Reddy's, and Garden Reach. Catch Lovisha Darad in conversation with Raja Venkatraman, Co-Founder, NeoTrader & Trading Influencer.",
