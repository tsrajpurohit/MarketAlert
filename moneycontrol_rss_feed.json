            "description": "Nifty 50 recorded a new closing high of 25,419, ending with moderate gains of 35 points on September 17. Gains were led by telecom, auto, and construction stocks. The gains come ahead of the US Federal Reserve monetary policy outcome, wherein market participants expect about 25 basis point interest rate cut. At close, the Sensex rose 80 points or 0.1% to 83,068, and the Nifty added 34 points, settling at 25,418.50. Market breadth was negative, with 1,616 stocks advancing, 2,176 declining, and 99 remaining unchanged. In the broader end of the markets - BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices declined up to 0.1 percent, while India VIX, which measures market volatility ticked up by a percent to settle at 12.6. Experts suggest that if the index gives a decisive close above 25,500 or climbs above the upward-sloping resistance trendline, then a rally towards 25,800 cannot be ruled out. The immediate support lies at 25,200. This morning global cues are mixed with Wall Street clocking a mixed close ahead of the US Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision later tonight.
