Despite the dip, the broader uptrend remains intact as the index continues to form a higher high\u2013higher low pattern, supported by strong momentum indicators. It has defended the 25,150\u201325,200 zone, which remains an immediate support, while 25,000 acts as a crucial base. On the upside, resistance is seen at 25,400\u201325,500, and a breakout above this range could pave the way to test the June swing high of 25,670, say experts. Stocks in focus today include HCL Tech, Just Dial, and Tech Mahindra, while LG Electronics makes its much-awaited D-Street debut.
