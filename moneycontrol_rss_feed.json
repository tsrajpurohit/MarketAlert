            "description": "Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty clocked biggest single day losses in a month in the previous session, weighed by index heavyweights. Factors such as tight fight in the US Presidential elections, Fed's interest rate decision, more Chinese stimulus measures on the horizon kept market mood in check. With Nifty nearly 9 percent down from record highs, experts expect the index to face resistance at 24,200, with support placed around 23,500. This morning global cues are mixed, with Wall Street ending overnight on a weak note. Asia-Pacific markets, meanwhile, were mixed this morning. Among stocks in focus, watch out for Dr Reddy's, Titan, and Raymond India.

            "description": "SG Mart operates in a massive total addressable market, which is traditional, fragmented, and unorganized.  The company has carved out three revenue streams related to the steel sector. The first one is pure trading of metals - where it is already doing 50,000-60,000 tons of monthly volumes, which is two times the largest distributor in the country. Secondly, it has set-up service centers to provide processed steel to automobile and consumer durable OEMs. The third is the retail distribution business of non-steel pipe products for which SG Mart will be using the APL Apollo brand free of cost.\n\nDescription:  SG Mart, an APL Apollo group company, is an emerging tech-based B2B (business-to-business) marketplace for construction materials with a huge addressable market. The company is in the midst of a hyper growth phase as the share of online B2B marketplace in the domestic construction materials market is pegged at just 1-2 percent, very minuscule, compared to the US and China, where it is around 15-20 percent.\n\n \n\nFor more details on the stock and the investment rationale, visit our Moneycontrol Research page\n\n #stockmarket #stockoftheday #bse #nse #stockstobuynow #stocksinfocus #stockmarketnews",
