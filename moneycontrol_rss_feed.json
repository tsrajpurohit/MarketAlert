            "description": "Bulls were back roaring last session, sending benchmark indices Sensex up by 1,400 points while Nifty surged nearly 500 points, breaking well past its 200-DMA. Majority of the support came in from auto, IT, and financial stocks, whereas broader indices underperformed. Over the next few days, investors will closely track Q3 business updates from companies as we step into the earnings season. Experts are eyeing Nifty's resistance at 24,200, with support placed around 24,900. This morning, global cues were mixed. US markets ended lower on the first day of 2025. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets traded higher. Among stocks in focus, watch out for Avenue Supermarts, Bank of Maharashtra, and NHPC.
