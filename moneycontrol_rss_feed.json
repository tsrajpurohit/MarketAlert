            "description": "The market closed off the day's low, halting its upward journey of the previous 14 consecutive days, on September 4. The Nifty 50 ended just below 25,200, down 81 points. Despite profit booking, the uptrend seems to be intact, and the index may march towards the 25,300-25,350 levels if it holds above 25,200 in the coming sessions, with immediate support at 25,100, experts said. This morning global cues are mixed with Nasdaq & S&P 500 booking back to back losses but Dow ekeing out gains. The GIFT Nifty is signalling a triple-digit rebound on the Nifty. Among stocks in focus today, watch out for Sona BLW, GIC Re and Suzlon among others.
