The index successfully held its 200-day EMA and maintained the bullish gap from March 24, signaling strength. As long as it stays above key moving averages, the overall trend is expected to remain positive. A sustained close above 23,400 could drive the index toward the 23,800\u201324,000 range. However, a decisive drop below 23,400 may shift momentum in favor of the bears, experts suggest. This morning global cues are tepid. BSE, HAL, BEL, Asian Paints, JSPL  will be in focus today.
