            "description": "The Nifty 50 logged its third straight gain on September 18, closing above 25,400 with a 93-point rise after the Fed\u2019s rate cut. Momentum stays with the bulls, though experts caution some consolidation could precede the next leg higher. 25,500 is now the key hurdle, aligned with a long-term falling trendline; a sustained move above it could set up a retest of the June peak at 25,669. Failure to clear that mark may trigger a pullback toward the 25,330\u201325,250 support zone. Global cues are mixed this morning and GIFT Nifty signals a soft start. Adani group stocks will be in focus after SEBI gave a clean chit in the Hindenburg case. Join Nandita Khemka in conversation with Raja Venkatraman, Co-Founder of NeoTrader, and Arvind Chari, Chief Investment Strategist at Q India (UK), for market insights and the day\u2019s top trading strategies.",
