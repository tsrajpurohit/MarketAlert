            "description": "Sensex Today | Stock Market LIVE Updates: US stocks plunged on Wednesday, with all three major indexes posting their biggest daily decline in months, after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point but disappointed some investors with projections that signaled a more cautious path of easing next year. The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points to the 4.25%-4.50% range and its summary of economic projections (SEP) indicated it will make rate cuts totaling a half percentage point by the end of 2025 given the solid labor market and the recent stall in lowering inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,123.03 points, or 2.58%, to 42,326.87, the S&P 500 lost 178.45 points, or 2.95%, to 5,872.16 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 716.37 points, or 3.56%, to 19,392.69.",
