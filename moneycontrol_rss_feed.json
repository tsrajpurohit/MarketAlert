            "description": "Nifty saw a 400 point reversal intraday yesterday to shut shop below the 23,900 level. All sectors ended in the red with PSUs, autos and metals leading the declines. Amid mixed global cues, the Indian indices opened higher with Nifty above 24,200 but erased all the gains in the initial hours and traded flat in the first half. However, increased profit booking dragged the Nifty index below 23,900 to close near day's low. Biggest losers on the Nifty were Britannia Industries, HDFC Bank, NTPC, Asian Paints and Bharat Electronics, while gainers included Trent, HCL Technologies, Sun Pharma, Infosys and Reliance Industries. Today the focus will be on the Nifty bank index as it will have its last weekly expiry. Among stocks, watch out for BSE, Nykaa and Eicher Motors among others. Swiggy is likely to make a subdued debut on Dalal Street.
