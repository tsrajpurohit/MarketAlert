            "description": "Nifty 50 rebounded sharply on May 23, breaking its five-day streak of lower highs with a 1% gain, closing near a key resistance level at 24,850. On the weekly chart, the index remains firmly above all major moving averages, reinforcing a positive long-term trend. However, analysts expect near-term consolidation, with the market likely to trade in a range. A sustained hold above 24,700 could pave the way for a move toward 25,000\u201325,200. Key support is seen at 24,460, close to last week\u2019s low. Stocks to watch include NTPC, JSW Steel, Glenmark, and Eternal. Meanwhile, two IPOs are set to debut on the primary market today: Brookfield-backed Schloss Bangalore (Leela Hotels) and Aegis Vopak Terminals, a unit of Aegis Logistics.
