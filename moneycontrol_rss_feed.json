            "description": "The market snapped its six-day losing streak on October 8, rising nearly a percent to close just above the 25,000 mark after a 5.6% decline from its all-time high. Experts feel consolidation is likely to be seen in the upcoming sessions until the index gives a strong close above 25,500, with key support in the 24,750-24,700 zone. If the index sustains above 25,000, immediate resistance on the higher side is likely to be at 25,200-25,300. However, if the index falls below 25,000, 24,800 is the immediate level to watch, according to experts. Meanwhile, the RBI will announce its policy decision today. The central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady for a tenth straight time, however, the stance may be changed to neutral from withdrawal of accommodation. Commentary from the RBI Governor on the road ahead may be a key factor in determining market sentiment in mid-week trading before TCS kickstarts the earnings season on Thursday.Among stocks in focus will be Dr Reddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, IRB Infra, Ola Electric and PB Fintech. Catch Nandita Khemka in conversation with Anil Rego, MD & CIO, Right Horizons PMS and Rajesh Palviya of Axis Securities.",
