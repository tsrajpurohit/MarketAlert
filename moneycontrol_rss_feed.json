            "description": "Indian equity market continued its consolidation for another week, slipping over half a percent, indicating an ongoing corrective phase. The week started cautiously, with investor sentiment dampened by concerns around the upcoming US Presidential elections. A brief mid-week rally followed the election results, but gains were short-lived, as volatility persisted amid various global events. As we move into the second week of November, investors will keep a close eye on several critical factors, including the final set of Q2FY25 earnings, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, FII flows, crude oil prices, global market trends, and key domestic and international macroeconomic data. On Wall Street, Trump-fuelled rally continued unabated with Dow toppling 44,000 for the first time and the S&P 500 ending at record high to cap election week rally. Among stocks to watch out for today will be SBI, as brokerages spell out their verdict on the stock post quarterly earnings, M&M, Asian Paints, LIC.
