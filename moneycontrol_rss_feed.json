Company's last quarterly result was soft due to labor shortages on account of the election and heatwaves in North India. This impacted real estate activities. Margins also dipped due to elevated logistics cost. However, with a focus on high-value products, acquisition of the \"Welcome brand\" to expand into paint thinners and continued strength in Unico (Wood coating), wall paints, and high-end decorative paints, future looks promising.",
