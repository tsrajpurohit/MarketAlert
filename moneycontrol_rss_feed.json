            "description": "The Nifty 50 gave up nearly 250 points from day\u2019s high on account of profit booking, but still managed to end with moderate gains on September 4. Experts say the trend could strengthen further if the index sustains above the 20- and 50-day EMAs. On the downside, 24,700 has emerged as immediate support, and a breach of this could open the door for a decline toward the 24,500\u201324,400 zone. On the upside, 25,000 remains the key decisive level for a move toward 25,500. The GIFT Nifty is hinting at a positive start this morning. Among stocks in focus today: Sammaan Capital, Biocon, Aarti Drugs, and Varun Beverages.
