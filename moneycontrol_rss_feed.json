            "description": "Nifty snapped its 10-day losing streak yesterday, closing over 1% higher as most index constituents participated in the rally. The market witnessed strong breadth, with eight stocks advancing for every one that declined in the last session. The 22,000 level remains a critical support for Nifty, adding to the significance of this rebound. All sectors ended in positive territory, with metal, IT, and auto stocks leading the recovery. Going ahead, experts now watch out Nifty's resistance around 22,500 and support around 21m960. This morning, global cues were positive. All major averages in the Wall Street ended over a percent higher. Asia-Pacfific markets also started the day good as US President Donald Trump granted one-month tariff exemption on automakers. Among stocks, watch out for Zydus Life, Wipro, and LIC Housing in today's trading session.
