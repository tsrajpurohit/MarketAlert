            "description": "US stocks declined on Tuesday, extending the steepest selloff in months, as investors grappled with concerns over the potential economic fallout from new tariff threats. Market volatility was high, driven by conflicting updates on tariffs, while brief optimism over progress toward a Ukraine-Russia ceasefire provided a temporary boost to equities. The S&amp;P 500 fell to an intraday low of 5,528.41, briefly entering a market correction with a 10% decline from its record close of 6,144.15 on February 19. President Donald Trump announced plans to double tariffs on all imported Canadian steel and aluminum products to 50%, just hours before they were set to take effect, but soon backtracked. Asian markets are trading mixed and the GIFT Nifty is trading marginally in the red. The Nifty made a good recovery from day\u2019s low to edge back near the 22,500 mark. Watch out for IndusInd Bank after the stock crashed 27% yesterday, also in focus will be Bharti Airtel &amp; PB Fintech. Catch Nandita Khemka in conversation with Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical &amp; Derivatives) at Axis Securities and Sandeep Bagla, CEO, TRUST Mutual Fund.",
