Benign domestic inflation, at an eight-year low, fueled optimism for a revival in discretionary spending. On the earnings front, Nifty50 Q1FY26 results were in line with market expectations, although the recovery in urban demand remains subdued.Global cues also contributed to the positive sentiment, with softer US inflation data and a drop in the US 10-year bond yield reinforcing expectations of a Fed rate cut in the September policy meeting. In the near term, stock-specific action is likely to continue, with a focus on domestic consumption-led sectors to counter volatility. Geopolitical events, particularly the upcoming Trump\u2013Putin meeting, may also act as catalysts for market sentiment. In this context, Axis Securities has highlighted the following stock picks for a horizon of over one year",
