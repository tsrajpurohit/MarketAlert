            "description": "There are two things clearly worth noticing this Diwali day. First, there are sectors that have been able to get back their momentum. Second, the market is in stock-specific mode. A company delivers growth, the market rewards it; if it does not, then there are enough people waiting to sell. There is a high probability that, as the market adjusts to valuations, we might see it staying in this mode for some time. Our selected stocks for today depict a strong upward trajectory in their overall average score which is based on five key pillars: Earnings, fundamentals, relative valuation, risk, and price momentum. This implies that there has been a significant improvement in their market outlook in the given time frame.",

            "description": "Tracking where major institutional investors, such as Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and Mutual Funds (MFs), are placing their bets is essential. Equally important is keeping an eye on where they\u2019re pulling back. According to the latest shareholding data for the September quarter, there are so far around 413 small-cap stocks that have holdings from both FIIs and MFs. Interestingly, in 71 of these stocks, both types of institutional investors have reduced their stake compared to the June quarter.When it comes to market performance, the picture isn\u2019t too rosy \u2014 nearly half of these 71 stocks have delivered negative returns so far in FY26. We have highlighted the top seven underperformers, which have plunged between 15% and 60% in just under seven months of the current fiscal year. (Data Source: ACE Equity).",
