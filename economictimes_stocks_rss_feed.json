While the BSE Sensex gained by 294.85 points or 0.37% to close at 80,796.84, the broader Nifty was up by 114.45 points or 0.47% to end the day at 24,461.15.Commenting on the day's action, Vatsal Bhuva, Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said that Nifty is holding above its rising 10-day EMA, reflecting a positive near-term trend. \"The Nifty index continues to trade within a narrow range of 24,200 to 25,500, with firm support at the 24,200\u201324,250 zone and resistance around 24,500\u201324,550. While a decisive breakout above 24,550 could spark bullish momentum towards 25,000, Monday\u2019s small-bodied candlestick suggests that short-term consolidation may persist. With the RSI in a bullish crossover, underlying strength remains intact. The outlook stays bullish as long as Nifty sustains above 24,200, though a strong close above 24,550 is essential for confirmation,\" he said.Here are 5 stock recommendations for Tuesday:",
