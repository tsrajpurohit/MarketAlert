To narrow down this list to fundamentally stronger bets, we applied an additional filter: we considered only those stocks that were held by more than 10 mutual funds as of May 2025. This is based on the rationale that mutual funds typically invest after conducting detailed research, which can offer investors added confidence in the company's fundamentals.
