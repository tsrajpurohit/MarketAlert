At this point of time, we are in a somewhat similar situation. Money, however, is made when one is able to think beyond what is happening in the short term. So, stick with companies where the quality of the balance sheet is strong and there is little need for further debt. The reason why we are focusing on the debt part is that when interest rates are low and there is easy liquidity, history tells us that many companies tend to go overboard and take on debt.",

But Monday\u2019s trade, as well as the way the market has been behaving over the past few sessions, just goes to show that volatility cannot be wished away. Even in a bullish market, you will see profit-booking, rational shifting, consolidation, or distribution. Whenever the market attempts to move into a fresh phase of upward movement, these things do happen. So, even as you turn bullish, be prepared to deal with volatility. And that means being selective and cautious, especially if you are interested in the mid-cap segment.",
