The upbeat revenue outlook from tech giant Infosys provided a much-needed boost to IT stocks, igniting early optimism in the market. However, nervousness regarding geopolitical issues led some investors to cash in on profits, resulting in a moderation of the earlier gains.",

            "description": "As December-quarter shareholding data for nearly 505 small-cap companies begins to roll out, early disclosures are already revealing an interesting market contradiction. A deeper analysis shows that retail investors have steadily reduced their stakes for three consecutive quarters in FY26 across 68 small-cap stocks. (Note: Retail investors are resident individuals holding nominal share capital up to Rs 2 lakhs)What makes this trend intriguing is the price action. More than half of these stocks\u201435 out of 68\u2014have delivered double-digit returns in FY26 so far, even as retail participation continued to decline. Is this retail profit-booking after a strong rally, or are investors prematurely stepping aside and missing the next leg of upside? The answer, as always, lies somewhere between caution and conviction\u2014and only time will tell. In this analysis, we spotlight 12 small-cap stocks that surged between 40% and 130% during FY26, including three multibaggers, highlighting a growing disconnect between ownership trends and market performance.

Against this backdrop of broader market weakness, about 47 stocks from the BSE 500 index fell in all five consecutive sessions. Among them, we identified 10 stocks that declined on each of the five days, posting cumulative losses of 10% to 22%. (Data Source: ACE Equity)",
