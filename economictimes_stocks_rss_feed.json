The reason, according to brokerage research reports \u2013 which then came out infrequently and were few in numbers \u2013 was that as the Indian economy opened up, more foreign business travellers would flock in, leading to higher occupancy. And as it is not easy to set up a 5-star hotel, the demand-supply equation would favor the sector. The sector did do well for a while, but then came a long period where these stocks did not give any returns. Now, once again, the cash registers are ringing.
