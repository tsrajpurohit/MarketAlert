For instance, the strong upward movement in base metal prices. This will impact inflation. Similarly, the impact of Chinese dumping is also being overlooked by the market. So, while it is time to be bullish with a long-term perspective, keep some of these things in mind. Our selected stocks for today depict a strong upward trajectory in their overall average score which is based on five key pillars: Earnings, fundamentals, relative valuation, risk, and price momentum. This implies that there has been a significant improvement in their market outlook in the given time frame.",

To identify such opportunities, we screened companies that posted robust year-on-year sales and profit growth of over 10% in the September quarter, while also maintaining healthy profit margins above 10% despite a challenging economic environment. Additionally, these companies saw an increase in FII shareholding during the September quarter compared to the previous quarter. The screening excluded banking and financial stocks and considered only companies with a market capitalisation above Rs 1,500 crore.Applying these filters across BSE-listed companies yielded a universe of around 100 stocks. We then added price performance criteria, which revealed that nearly half of these stocks have delivered double-digit returns in CY25 so far. From this group, we shortlisted 14 standout stocks that rallied between 50% and 530% over the past year. Notably, three of these stocks more than doubled investor wealth during the same period.
