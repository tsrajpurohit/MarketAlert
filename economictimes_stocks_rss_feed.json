Also a sort of outperformance in the bearish phase where they did not decline like other stocks in the market. They are not in the news any more; nor are many talking about them on TV. All signs suggesting it might probably be time to look at them again. But this time do it from a very different perspective \u2013 and not just because they are PSU. What matters is the category of business they fall into.",

Yes, traders. Now, why would dividend yield, of all things, act like a support line? The explanation lies in market memory and psychology. Around a certain level of dividend yield, value-oriented funds begin to step in because the price suddenly offers the comfort of an income stock. Momentum traders see valuation support and a floor building underneath the price. Options desks recalibrate, as downside looks limited and covered calls turn attractive. Each group is reacting to its own cues, but collectively they create the reflexive bounce that turns weakness into opportunity for traders.",
