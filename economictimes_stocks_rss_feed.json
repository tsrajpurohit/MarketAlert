            "description": "Indian frontline indices broke their four-session losing streak after banks and auto stocks chipped in to be counted following massive selling pressure in IT stocks. The mood was upbeat also because the December CPI inflation eased to its four-month low of 5.22%. While the S&P BSE Sensex settled at 76,499.63, gaining by 169.62 points or 0.22%, the broader Nifty closed at 23,176.05, higher by 90.10 points or 0.39%.Commenting on the day's action, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities called the day's trade as choppy as he decoded the Nifty chart highlighting the formation of a bullish Harami Cross pattern. \"A bullish Harami pattern, especially after a significant correction, often signals a potential short-term recovery. The Nifty appears positive for the short term as long as it remains above 23,135. On the upside, it could move towards 23,400, and a decisive move above 23,400 may lead to higher levels,\" De said.",

And it is now accompanied by two major headwinds: One, rising oil prices; and two, higher US bond yields. In this scenario, you can well question the logic of looking at mid-caps stocks. So ask yourself this question: Will all the things bothering the market change the business outlook of the company whose stock you want to buy? Consider this: For oil companies that import oil and sell only in the domestic market, the rising rupee is an issue. But for oil companies that import oil, refine it, and then export it, it is much less of an issue. So, while the markets are volatile, try to understand the dynamics of the businesses underlying stocks and decide accordingly.",
