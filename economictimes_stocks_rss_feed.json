            "description": "While there can be a debate on whether, after the run up that hotel stocks saw in the last three years, are they cheap or not, and whether one should buy them now.

Now the question is if one buys only one set of stocks, for example hotel stocks, they come with their own plus and minus, right from the business risk of that industry to the fact that in tourism business, there are many segments, so there is a premium segment, there are travelers who travels by train and stay in medium size hotel which are not even listed. But then he has spent money in booking his ticket which has been captured on a railways ticketing platform. So, why not have that railway ticketing platform in a small portion of the portfolio.",

So, one has to strike a balance between being bullish and finding the stocks which in case of a decline in market fall less. While there is no full proof of doing it, there are some simple things that if one looks at before buying the stocks, it would help in finding the stocks which have higher probability delivering return with relative lesser drawn down.",
