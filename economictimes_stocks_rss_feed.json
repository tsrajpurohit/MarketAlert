            "description": "For all those rattled by volatility, here\u2019s a history lesson. 2008: The global financial crisis crushes risk assets. 2013: The \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d punishes emerging market currencies and equities; domestic panic about current account deficits and inflation make quality stocks look dangerous.

The pattern is clear: Shocks arrive, stock prices wobble, strong businesses adjust, and time repairs the damage.
