            "description": "From railways to defence to power. The last four years have seen many surprise winners in terms of sectors. What are the typical characteristics of a sector that turns out to be a surprise winner? It would have faced headwinds for many years, even decades, with too many laws governing it; be fragmented, with too many small- and mid-sized companies, one or two large players, and hyper-competition. It is cyclical or seasonal in nature. Another feature: Some companies from the sector would have spelt trouble for the banking system at some point. If you look at the history of the cement sector, it has experienced all of the above. Then comes a phase of consolidation, with things turning around, albeit slowly. But analysts and the street remain wary and skeptical.",
