One such is what the auditor is saying about a company. Why is this important? Because what the auditor says, often buried under piles of data points, provides clues about the quality of the company, the processes it follows, whether it is trying to hide anything. In this series, we will try to make things like this as simple as possible. If you are seriously interested in knowing about companies and the stock market, then read on.",

But it is useful even to traders. How? Let's take an example:  Hindustan Unilever (the stock is not in our list) rarely yields above 1%. If it did approach, say, 2% due to a sharp stock correction, it would likely be a strong value signal, indicating that, for the first time in years, it\u2019s cheap relative to its dividend payouts. There are some steps to be followed which will probably help people use this matrix both while investing and trading.
