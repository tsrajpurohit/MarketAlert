One example to put this in perspective: 100% of HCV/LCV sales take place on credit. A majority of cars are also financed. Similarly, with two-wheelers; much of the sales are financed. Now all these categories reflect a part of the economy. HCV/LCVs sales suggest greater movement of goods and services. Cars move people and have an aspirational value. Two-wheelers move the common man. And the common connection? They are all financed. Who provides finance? Banks or NBFCs. And who finances NBFCs, directly or indirectly ? Yes, banks.",
