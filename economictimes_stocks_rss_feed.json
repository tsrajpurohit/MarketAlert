            "description": "Dalal Street celebrated the RBI's expected 'dovish pause' and Governor Malhotra's pro-market initiatives, ending an 8-day losing streak. Sensex surged over 600 points as RBI allowed banks to fund M&A, liberalized loans against shares, and reduced risk weights for infrastructure financing. These measures, coupled with optimistic GDP and inflation forecasts, significantly boosted market sentiment, especially for banking and infrastructure stocks.",

This situation can often indicate that these stocks are undervalued compared to their historical valuations. Interestingly, in just the last three months, the share prices of 10 small-cap stocks from the list have already risen sharply, increasing in the range of 15% to 100%.At first glance, this seems like a strong hint that the broader small-cap segment could be undervalued and attractive for investors. However, valuations alone do not guarantee profitable investments. A lower P/E ratio compared to history is simply an entry point for further analysis\u2014it does not automatically mean that the stock is a good buy. Other factors such as the company\u2019s fundamentals, sector outlook, balance sheet strength, corporate governance, and overall economic conditions must also be considered.
