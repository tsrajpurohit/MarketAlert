This appears to be the right thing to do in the initial phase of any correction, as it is often large-caps that lead the drawdown. The fact, however, remains that, over the long term, large caps not only create more wealth but they protect it in bearish phases.

It is just that a good amount of money is flowing into mid- and small-cap MF schemes \u2013 and that is fueling a rally in these stocks.",
