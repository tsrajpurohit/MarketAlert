Financials and IT stocks weighed on the index, while auto and FMCG names helped cushion the downside and prevented a deeper fall. The 50-stock index closed the week forming a small candlestick on the weekly chart, indicating hesitation at higher levels.Commenting on the current trends, Vatsal Bhuva, Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said that Nifty\u2019s RSI has drifted into a bearish crossover with lower tops on the hourly chart, suggesting bulls may take a breather at these levels. \u201cHowever, support remains visible at 26,100 and 26,000, while resistance is placed at 26,300. The technical setup suggests the index may trade in a range, with immediate support at 26,100 and resistance around 26,300\u201326,350 levels. Closing above 26,300 levels will open the door for 26,600 levels,\u201d Bhuva said.Here are 5 stock recommendations for Monday:",
