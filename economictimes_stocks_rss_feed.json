That, however, does not mean you should continue to look at stocks with the bearish bias that six months of decline is bound to have created. So, be somewhat bullish, but not reckless. At this juncture, the key is to keep an eye on the Q1 earnings. That will play an important role in how things pan out in the medium term.",

This approach helps filter for low-priced, actively traded small stocks showing strong momentum (Data Source: ACE Equity).Penny stocks often attract attention due to their low entry price and the potential for explosive growth. But while the rewards can be impressive, the risks are equally high. These stocks typically carry low liquidity, high volatility, and limited financial transparency.

Then the RBI reduced interest rates, which meant lower EMIs. Now, what will consumers do when they have more money in their hands? They will either spend more, or save more. The probability that they will spend more is higher. And when consumers spend more, the money comes back into the economy. Now, there is an established route by which money tends to flow back into the economy. It initially goes to some sectors and companies which tend to have more sales whenever consumers have higher spending power.",
