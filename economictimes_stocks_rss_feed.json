Now, is there any point in trying to guess when this phase of volatility will end? Not really. It may end this week, or it may continue for some time. That, however, does not mean you should continue to look at stocks with the bearish bias that six months of decline is bound to have created. So, be somewhat bullish, but not reckless. At this juncture, the key is to keep an eye on the Q1 earnings. That will play an important role in how things pan out in the medium term.",

Interestingly, four of these stocks more than doubled investors\u2019 wealth within this period. These high performers were identified using a focused set of criteria: each stock has a market capitalisation under Rs 1,000 crore, a share price below Rs 20, and a minimum recent trading volume of 5 lakh shares. This approach helps filter for low-priced, actively traded small stocks showing strong momentum (Data Source: ACE Equity).Penny stocks often attract attention due to their low entry price and the potential for explosive growth. But while the rewards can be impressive, the risks are equally high. These stocks typically carry low liquidity, high volatility, and limited financial transparency. Investors should proceed with caution \u2014success in penny stocks requires not just luck, but a clear strategy and strong risk management.",
