While the short-term trend is down, a pullback rally remains possible if Nifty holds above 23,500, according to Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates.",

Today's decline was led by FMCG and pharma stocks, which wiped out earlier morning gains. While the S&P BSE Sensex fell by 110 points, or 0.14%, to close at 77,580, the broader Nifty dropped by 26 points, or 0.11%, to end at 23,532, amid concerns over foreign outflows.Commenting on the day's action, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said that the Nifty closed near its 200-day EMA, forming a gravestone doji-like pattern on the daily chart, signaling bearish sentiment. \"This suggests a 'sell on rise' approach, as the index hovers in an oversold zone near a key EMA level. A bounce is likely, but it should be seen as an opportunity to sell. If Nifty breaks below the 200-day EMA, selling pressure could intensify. The index has support at 23,450, with resistance expected at 23,650, framing the short-term trading range,\" De said.Here are 3 stock recommendations for Monday:",

In a bull market, these MFs may find it difficult to buy such stocks. But as soon as the bears arrive, they not only find the opportunity to do so, but also become bottom makers. Now, bottom makers are buyers who ensure that a stock does not fall below a certain level \u2013 in this case, these MFs buy some stocks when they fall to a certain level. Because, at that level, dividend yield becomes reason enough to buy them. Two months back it was tough to find a stock with a dividend yield matching the interest rate of a savings bank account. Today there are some matching rates offered by fixed deposits. But they come with more than the usual caveats.",

Just this year, in March, market breadth suffered a lot, though at that time the cut in the Nifty and Sensex was lesser than what it has been this time. As an investor, your focus has to be on owning the correct business \u2013 and not corrections. Now, what is a \u201ccorrect business\u201d? Simple: One with a track record of growth; a company that does not require constant doses of capital; and where not only is income generated, it is shared with minority investors as dividends. The other important thing: Stick to the nine basic principles of investing.",

The listing was at a premium, and there was a mad rush to buy the stock. The reason: The group has a track record of corporate governance and wealth creation. Today, in a volatile, falling market, that stock has corrected sharply and is available much cheaper. All talk of big industry and promoters with a track record seems to have vanished just because the Nifty and Sensex are falling. So treat this overall market correction as an opportunity to own a good business with great management. We take a look at four stocks where business is good, promoters have a track record, and the only thing which appears bad is market conditions.",
