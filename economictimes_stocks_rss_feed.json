One example to put this in perspective: 100% of HCV/LCV sales take place on credit. A majority of cars are also financed. Similarly, with two-wheelers; much of the sales are financed. Now all these categories reflect a part of the economy. HCV/LCVs sales suggest greater movement of goods and services. Cars move people and have an aspirational value. Two-wheelers move the common man. And the common connection? They are all financed. Who provides finance? Banks or NBFCs. And who finances NBFCs, directly or indirectly ? Yes, banks.",

From the NSE midcap segment, we have highlighted the top seven stocks whose market prices are trading above their book values, based on June '25 quarter results data, as per StockEdge valuation Scans.Price above book value, typically indicates that investors expect the company to generate strong future earnings, possess valuable intangible assets, or maintain a competitive edge. A price above book value is common among high-growth or well-managed firms, but if not supported by fundamentals, it may also signal overvaluation. Book value is the net worth of a company as recorded on its balance sheet. It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets. When divided by the number of outstanding shares, it gives the book value per share. (Note: Market price refers to the previous day's closing value.)",
