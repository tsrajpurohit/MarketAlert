But beneath the calm surface of the headline numbers, the broader market has delivered a far more dramatic story. Across the BSE universe, several stocks extended their strong multi-bagger rallies from 2024. Yet, just as many high-flyers from last year have come crashing down to earth in 2025. To track this reversal, we screened for companies with a market capitalisation above Rs 2,500 crore that doubled investors\u2019 wealth in 2024 but have since corrected more than 30% this year.Roughly 25 stocks met the criteria. Among them, we spotlight 12 names that have taken the sharpest hit, falling over 35% in 2025 after delivering spectacular gains in the previous year. These former market darlings now serve as a reminder of how quickly sentiment can shift in India\u2019s fast-moving equity landscape. (Data Source: ACE Equity)",
