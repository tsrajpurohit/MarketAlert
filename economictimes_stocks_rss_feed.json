            "description": "In this episode of Two Sharp with ET, Nisha Poddar dives into two major developments that could redefine India\u2019s industrial strategy.First, is India quietly shelving its biggest manufacturing reform? According to a Reuters report, the Modi government is letting its $23 billion Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme wind down\u2014just four years after launch. The plan, meant to boost domestic production and reduce reliance on China, is not being extended, and companies that missed targets won\u2019t get deadline relaxations. Second, copper is emerging as the new industrial battleground. As former U.S. President Donald Trump threatens tariffs on copper imports, global prices have surged past $10,000 a ton. Indian conglomerates are responding fast. These moves come as India struggles with a copper shortfall that\u2019s vital for EVs, electronics, and clean energy infrastructure.",

Even after all the mayhem of the past six months, on a one-year trailing returns basis these stocks are still in the green. But now a narrative has emerged that, because F&O segment volumes have dipped after the implementation of new rules in November 2024, these stocks are not as attractive.
