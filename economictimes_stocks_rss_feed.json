One reason, however, to keep these stocks on a watchlist is that Indian auto majors hardly export any vehicles to the US, so the negative sentiment impacting other sectors will not hit them. At the same time, there is a headwind which may or may not become big. But the fact is that India's growth story is incomplete without the auto sector. So, eventually, the headwinds will not matter.",
