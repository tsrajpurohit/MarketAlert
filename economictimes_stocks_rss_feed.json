This suggests that while Diwali euphoria temporarily lifted many names, the rally fizzled out in most cases once the fireworks ended. In contrast, 39 smallcap stocks not only delivered 10%+ returns before Diwali 2024 but continued their rally afterwards \u2014 offering sustained gains ranging from 25% to a staggering 200% over the last 12 months. Among these consistent outperformers, nine stocks emerged as true multibaggers, each delivering 100% or more returns since Diwali 2024 \u2014 effectively doubling in value. It\u2019s important to note, however, that past performance does not guarantee future results. (Data Source: ACE Equity)",
