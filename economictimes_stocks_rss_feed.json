            "description": "If you are a long-term investor, your decisions cannot be based on what the Nifty or Sensex do every week, or even every quarter. So, if you are someone who is in the habit of looking at the indices every evening then these stocks might not fit in your portfolio. These are stocks that have survived even as the market has gone through both long and short phases of correction. And created wealth. These are stocks you need to hold \u2013 rather than sell or buy based on index movements. They are, at the end of the day, large and good businesses. And that is what matters to the markets.",

Just because the stock price is moving up does not mean the business is also improving, and vice versa. To reiterate: Look at what is happening to the underlying business. If there is any improvement in the business, only then look at that stock.",

Despite a 30% decline in transaction volume compared to the previous year, the fundraising proceeds dropped marginally by 2%. This indicates that, although fewer companies accessed the public markets, the quality and scale of IPO offerings remained robust, according to data compiled by EY.This trend suggests a more selective approach from both issuers and investors, with companies prioritising optimal market timing and valuation strategies. A cautious environment has emerged due to ongoing global uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. As a result, many high-profile companies have opted to postpone their IPOs. Nonetheless, a strong pipeline of IPOs is expected to launch in the second half of 2025, as companies position themselves for improved market conditions.",
