Nifty's lackluster trade in the last three sessions has dragged the index below the 21EMA. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said that a mild negative divergence on the daily chart has contributed to the recent weakness in momentum. \"On the hourly chart, a rising trendline offers immediate sup port; however, if Nifty slips below this trendline, a slide towards 25,900 may follow.
