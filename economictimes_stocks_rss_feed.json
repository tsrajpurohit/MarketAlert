            "description": "In the stock market, many investors hesitate to buy high-priced stocks as they fear larger losses if prices decline. Since these shares require a bigger investment, even a small quantity can feel costly. ETMarkets.com conducted a study on such high-priced stocks, focusing on companies that were trading above Rs 3,000 per share with a market capitalization of over Rs 3,000 crore two years ago. Within the BSE universe, 75 stocks met this criteria. At that time, MRF topped the list as the costliest stock, trading at Rs 1,08,626 per share. Two years later, it continued to hold the crown at Rs 1,55,968, delivering a remarkable 43% rally over this period.What stands out even more is that 13 of these high-value stocks have more than doubled in price, rewarding investors with gains exceeding 100% in just two years. Several of them are now trading well above the Rs 10,000 mark per share. On the other hand, not all of these premium names have delivered positive returns. Stocks such as National Standard, Tasty Bite Eatables, and Sanofi India have slipped between 30\u201360% during the same time frame. Still, the data reveals that the winners outweigh the laggards, with a significant number of multibaggers emerging from this basket of high-priced stocks. (Data Source: ACE Equity).",
