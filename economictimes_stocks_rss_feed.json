            "description": "Many investors are attracted to low-priced stocks, but random selection can be risky. It would be interesting to see when foreign investors are showing interest in these stocks, as they usually invest only after thorough research.To identify these stocks, ETMarkets analyzed those trading below Rs 20 at the end of the March 2024 quarter, with a market cap exceeding Rs 250 crore, and noted an increase in FII holdings in the June quarter compared to March 2024. From the BSE universe, about 23 stocks met these criteria. We further refined this list and highlighted 8 stocks that have gained over 50% in the first five months of FY25.
