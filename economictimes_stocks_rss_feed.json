These laggards were identified through a focused screening process that considered companies with a market capitalisation under Rs 1,000 crore, a share price below Rs 20, and a minimum recent trading volume of 5 lakh shares. The approach aims to spotlight low-priced, actively traded penny stocks that have seen substantial declines. (Data Source: ACE Equity)Although penny stocks often attract investors with their low entry prices and potential for rapid gains, they come with substantial risks.
