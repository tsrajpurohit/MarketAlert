(Data Source: ACE Equity)Although penny stocks often attract investors with their low entry prices and potential for rapid gains, they come with substantial risks. Due to low liquidity, high volatility, and limited transparency, they are prone to manipulation and sudden drops. Without a clear strategy and strong risk controls, investors may face more losses than gains.",
