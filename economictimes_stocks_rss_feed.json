            "description": "With the additional 25% tariff all but a reality, here's a question: What will President Trump say or do next? Can anyone predict that? The answer is no.

At such a juncture, you will do well to remember that while the markets are about buying and selling, there is a third option. Which is hold. And when it comes to wealth creation, there are times when it is more important to just hold on to stocks. So if you have quality stocks, stop analysing what is happening to the Nifty and Sensex every day.",
