            "description": "After trimming exposure for two straight quarters, mutual funds shifted gears in the September 2025 quarter, emerging as selective buyers in the broader market. They raised their stakes in 38 BSE 500 stocks, reversing the cautious stance seen during the December 2024\u2013March 2025 and March\u2013June 2025 periods. The move indicates that fund managers, who had stayed on the sidelines earlier, are gradually re-entering the market in chosen names.Performance among these stocks in CY25 has been uneven. While 13 stocks delivered double-digit returns of up to 55%, about 22 slipped into negative territory, with six witnessing steep declines of 30\u201360%. Still, mutual funds are considered informed investors, guided by deep research and long-term fundamentals, and their renewed buying after sustained cuts often reflects rising confidence in business prospects rather than expectations of quick price gains. We highlighted the top seven gainers, which surged 30\u201355%, as well as the major laggards that declined 30\u201360% in CY25. (Data Source: ACE Equity)",
