All this is on the fundamental side, and one could have taken a call whether to buy or sell the stock based on the fundamentals alone. There is, however, another side of the story: During this period, Infosys\u2019 dividend payout kept rising steadily: From \u20b921.5 in FY19 to \u20b943 in FY25. For traders (who don't usually look at dividend payouts), there is a way to use this information to increase the probability of getting a trade, especially on the long side, right.
