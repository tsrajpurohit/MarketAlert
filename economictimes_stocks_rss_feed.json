Among companies valued at over Rs 2,000 crore, around 83 firms stand out for having exceptionally high retail participation, with individual investors holding more than 25% of the stake. For context, retail here refers to resident individuals with a nominal shareholding of up to Rs 2 lakh. As of the June 2025 quarter, Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar topped the list with retail investors owning a hefty 47.15% of the company, closely followed by South Indian Bank at 46.52%. Yet, despite such confidence, both stocks delivered negative returns post-June\u2014falling about 14% and 4% respectively.The September quarter (July to present) has revealed an uncomfortable truth: most of these retail-heavy stocks are leaving small investors in the red. While the enthusiasm of high retail ownership suggests strong conviction, the returns so far have been largely disappointing. To get a clearer picture, we dug deeper into the performance trends. From the beginning of July to now, a breakdown of the top 5 gainers and top 5 losers among these 83 retail-heavy stocks, we uncover where small investors\u2019 collective bets have paid off\u2014and where they\u2019ve turned sour.
