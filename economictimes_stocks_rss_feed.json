The rest, genuine long-term investors, focus on the correct businesses. \u201cCorrect business\u201d? Yes, one with a record of growth; which does not require frequent capital infusions; and where income is shared with minority investors.

Also, stock selection is the key given high valuations. Finally, manage behavioural risk. And that is something investors have to work out on their own.",

Taxation, especially STT, CTT, and capital gains, adds friction and makes India less competitive globally. Predictable, rational tax policy and long-term support for mutual funds are crucial to sustain domestic capital formation. Higher capex, especially in defence and infrastructure, is essential for long-term growth.",
