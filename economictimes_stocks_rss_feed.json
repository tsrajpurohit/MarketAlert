            "description": "While the market is surely under the control of bulls, there are initial indications that the Street might see some volatility due to profit booking. One has to make a distinction between what is causing the volatility, because the underlying reason plays an important part in deciding the magnitude and time period of correction.  First phase of the volatility is normally led by large cap stocks, so there could be some selling pressure, But the other fact is that recovery in the market is also largely led by the large cap and they stabilized much before other segments of the market.  ET screener powered by Refinitiv\u2019s Stock Report Plus lists down quality stocks with high upside potential over the next 12 months, having an average recommendation rating of \u201cbuy\u201d or \"strong buy\". The screener applies different algorithms for all BSE and NSE stocks.",
