            "description": "Over the past month, 12 penny stocks have recorded steep losses, falling between 20% and 65%. These laggards were identified through a focused screening process that considered companies with a market capitalisation below Rs 1,000 crore, a share price under Rs 20, and a minimum trading volume of 5 lakh shares in the recent period. The aim was to highlight low-priced, actively traded penny stocks that have witnessed sharp declines. (Data Source: ACE Equity)While penny stocks often entice investors with low entry prices and the prospect of quick gains, they carry significant risks. Their low liquidity, high volatility and limited disclosures make them prone to manipulation and sudden crashes. Without a clear strategy and strict risk controls, investors may incur substantial losses.",

Historically, larger players suffered a tax arbitrage disadvantage compared to the unorganised market, much of which operated outside the GST net. With rates now lower or zero on dairy items, the playing field has been levelled. The result?
