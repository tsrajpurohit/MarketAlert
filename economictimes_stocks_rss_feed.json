The numbers tell a different story, if one looks at overall numbers except for calendar year 2022, where they have been net sellers, FPIs have been investing in India. In 2023 and in 2024 as on date, they have been net buyers. So, there is a difference in perception and reality. Now the question is where is the FPI money going and is the DII money which surely has seen a rise thanks to SIP flows into mutual funds is also going in the same direction where the FII money is going. We looked at a set of stocks and change in shareholding for the last three years and there are X stocks where FPI have been buyers, increasing their stake and DII have been reducing their stake. Now this could be for many reasons, but who will be proven right, FII or DII.",
