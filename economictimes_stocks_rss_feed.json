He also highlights that this level served as a consolidation base in June, making it a technically significant support area.Vinay Rajani adds that the derivative data signals an oversold condition, with the FII long-to-short ratio in index futures at a very low 0.17. This extreme reading suggests that short-covering by FIIs could take place soon, increasing the potential for a technical bounce from this key support zone.",
