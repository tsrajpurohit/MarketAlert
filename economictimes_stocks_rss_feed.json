This is an example of why it is important to keep track of what managements of some companies say. They feel the pulse of the economy. And, in the end, it is the economy that drives earnings, and earnings that drive the stock market. So, here is a set of companies that will have a better idea of what to expect in 2026.",

            "description": "The way things are panning out in the markets, the bulls are steadily but clearly gaining control. Yes, we will continue to see small phases of correction, but the overall bias is expected to remain towards the bulls. The likely difference this time is that the market may be more stock- or even sector-specific. This will be unlike the past when it was an across-the-board rally, especially in mid-caps.",
