            "description": "There is a difference between a large-cap stock and a large runway for business. Just to put in context: When you buy Larsen & Toubro (LT), you own a part of the best engineering and technical minds of this country. But will the infrastructure, construction and engineering business grow at the same pace every year? The answer is, no. But will it grow in the long term? The answer is, yes. Owning LT is, thus, probably the best thing to do in the long term. But you have to live with phases of underperformance. So, learn to ignore the noise about a stock\u2019s price and focus on the business which you will own when you buy it. Focus on owning a part of good business, rather than what the Nifty and Sensex are doing every day.",

Investors remained wary ahead, leading to persistent selling pressure at higher levels.\"Nifty closed near its immediate support and Fibonacci 0.50 retracement level, making 23,300 a crucial level to hold for any recovery. The 23,800\u201323,850 range, coinciding with a previous swing high, continues to act as a strong supply zone, further bolstered by aggressive call writing. Notably, the RSI has slipped below 50, indicating fading bullish momentum and rising sluggishness,\" said Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Analyst, SAMCO Securities.Here are 5 stock recommendations for Tuesday",

Because that has a strong correlation to the probability that you will buy the stock again at a higher price. These days, with bears in control of the street, it needs some ability to be contrarian. But just ask yourself the question: Do you think the Nifty being at 23000 or 24000 makes a difference to the bottom lines of companies, say, from the sugar sector that have successfully transitioned from being just agro-commodity stocks to being part of the clean energy basket?",
