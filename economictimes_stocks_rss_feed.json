            "description": "Volatility is back on the front page, and you may hear more about it next week. Fresh tariff headlines from the US, a bout of valuation anxiety at home, and the usual chorus of \u201cthis time is different\u201d have turned the screens red and the mood bearish. If you\u2019ve been investing in the stock market for more than a few monsoons, though, you\u2019ve watched this movie before. But investing is not like movies which get over in three hours max. Investing is about the underlying value of good businesses which do not get distorted by statements or headline hoggers.",

            "description": "Along with semiconductors, electronics and IT, pharma is another sector exempt from the Trump tariffs. Still, as the broader indices declined after the imposition of two rounds of tariffs, with the latest of 25% kicking in on August 27, pharma stocks have also seen drops over the past month. Now, is this an opportunity, given that the sector is exempt? Perhaps. Because, one does not know what President Trump may do in the future. But the pharma sector merits a closer look for reasons other than being exempt from tariffs. For, in the last 20 years, companies in this sector, because of some inherent advantages, have been able to deliver. And going forward, there is a high probability that these tailwinds will increase.",
