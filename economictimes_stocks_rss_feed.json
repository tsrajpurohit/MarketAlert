            "description": "With the additional 25% tariff all but a reality, here's a question: What will President Trump say or do next? Can anyone predict that? The answer is no. So, if you cannot predict what the man responsible for all the recent market turmoil will do, why try to predict what will happen to stock prices? At such a juncture, you will do well to remember that while the markets are about buying and selling, there is a third option. Which is hold. And when it comes to wealth creation, there are times when it is more important to just hold on to stocks. So if you have quality stocks, stop analysing what is happening to the Nifty and Sensex every day.",

Each has its own operating matrix, supply chain, and demand. Just to put this in perspective: Fluorochemicals & fluoropolymers are currently facing overcapacity, but others are in a shortage situation because China hit a pause on exports. For some companies, trouble in China means a big bonus; for others, it means supply chain issues affecting production in India. The Chinese companies themselves have gone through many ups and downs in the past three years. From increasing capacity to cater to the EV boom to pricing wars as they tried to muscle into Europe. All this had its impact on India. We are not saying that things have changed, but Indian companies have learnt to live with increased competition. And that is a good enough reason to revisit these stocks.",
