            "description": "Indian headline indices struggled to gain momentum through the day after a sluggish start as weak global cues and the absence of new drivers weighed heavily on the markets. A broad-based sell-off led to declines across sectors, with IT, auto, and FMCG stocks being the biggest drag on the Nifty 50. At the closing time, the S&P BSE Sensex slipped by 318.76 points or 0.39% to settle at 81,501.36, while the Nifty dropped 86.00 points or 0.34% to finish at 24,971.30.Commenting on the day's action, expert Tejas Shah of JM Financial & BlinkX said that Nifty is showing indecisiveness at the current juncture. The 50-stock index formed a DOJI candle on its daily chart which indicates this indecisiveness and presently, Nifty is in 'No Man\u2019s Land', Shah said. \"Broadly, Nifty is still trading in the range of 24,950 to 25,250 levels for the past few days and we need to wait and watch for either side breakout or breakdown for 250 to 300 points of directional move in Nifty. Support for Nifty is now seen at 24,950-25,000 and 24,700-750. On the higher side, immediate resistance for Nifty is at 25,100 levels and the next crucial resistance zone is at 25,250-300 levels,\" he added.Here are 5 stock recommendations for Thursday:",

But, given that the long-term trend is still bullish, how do you deal with the current situation if you have a surplus to invest? There are two options. One, sit out of the market and let this phase pass. Second, become a tactical investor. Rather than investing with an extremely long-term perspective, buy stocks for shorter terms with a clear focus on booking profits. For example, four weeks back, there was a tactical trade in metals. Now it is largely over. So, make a tactical trade, but only in select stocks. Even if for some reason you are not able to cash out in time, these would be good enough businesses to keep in your portfolio.",

The correction has to be seen in the context that, at this time of the year, markets anyway tend to be more volatile. Yes, companies that are disappointing the street with their Q2 numbers are getting punished. But it is not leading to strong across-the-board weakness. At this point, there is a high probability that, given there are no global hiccups, this phase of correction will pass without major damage to individual stocks.
