This occurrence may be seen as a bullish sign, indicating the potential for further upward movement in the stock. However, it's worth noting that this is different from a 5-year breakout, which occurs when a stock's price surpasses a key resistance level that has held for five years or longer.",

The reasons could be many: Change in management, change in macro structure of the sector, government policy. The bottom line, however, is that the total addressable market, or market size, for the goods or services of the company has become bigger and management was smart enough to take advantage of that. In the last 10 years, as the whole size and scope of the Indian economy has changed, there are new sectors and industries emerging and that probably it might be worthwhile to get them on a watchlist.",
