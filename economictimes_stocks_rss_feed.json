            "description": "There is a difference between a large-cap stock and a large runway for business. Just to put in context: When you buy Larsen & Toubro (LT), you own a part of the best engineering and technical minds of this country. But will the infrastructure, construction and engineering business grow at the same pace every year? The answer is, no. But will it grow in the long term? The answer is, yes. Owning LT is, thus, probably the best thing to do in the long term. But you have to live with phases of underperformance. So, learn to ignore the noise about a stock\u2019s price and focus on the business which you will own when you buy it. Focus on owning a part of good business, rather than what the Nifty and Sensex are doing every day.",
