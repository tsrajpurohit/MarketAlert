            "description": "While it might not be conventional, an investor and a trader may look at the same parameter to decide on two different things: An investing decision and trading strategy. Of course, we are not in a conventional market. We have had a week in which FPIs sold more than Rs. 25,000 crore worth of stocks. Yet, the index declined by just 4%. Before 2019, the damage would have been far worse. So, in times like these, some basic work needs to be done before making an investment decision. Especially so if you entered the market after 2020 \u2013 and have only seen a bull run.",

            "description": "This week the Nifty corrected 4%. But did all Nifty stocks correct equally? The answer, obviously, is no. That never happens. If the volatility and correction continues, the Nifty stocks that fell in this round may not be the ones to get battered in the future. The market sees different kinds of sell-offs at different times. And the kind of sell-off decides the pace of the correction in the Nifty and Bank Nifty \u2013 both important indices. Understanding this is important. Right now the markets are correcting not only due to a sudden outflow and global developments, but also because we are close to the earning season. How that pans out will have a major impact on how the Nifty and the broader market behave in the short term.",
