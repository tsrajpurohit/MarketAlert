Second, those that moved later, largely because their customers were unsure about their EV roadmap and timelines. Third, those that simply misjudged the pace of transition and were caught off guard by how quickly EV adoption picked up. And fourth, firms for whom the shift is almost impossible to ride, because the components they make have little or no relevance in an EV world. Given this, there is, naturally, a realignment in the auto ancillary space.",

To do so, we screened BSE small-cap companies that reported strong year-on-year sales and profit growth of over 10% in the September quarter, while sustaining healthy profit margins above 10%. We further narrowed the list to companies that saw a rise in mutual fund shareholding during the September quarter compared with the previous quarter, excluding banking and financial stocks.Applying these criteria to the BSE small-cap universe resulted in a pool of around 74 stocks. We then layered in price performance filters, which showed that about 47 of these stocks have already generated double-digit returns in FY26. From this subset, we identified 13 standout performers that have delivered price returns ranging between 50% and 162% in FY26 so far, with five stocks emerging as multibaggers.
