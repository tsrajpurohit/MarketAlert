            "description": "At this point of time, there can be no debate on valuations, it is a well accepted fact that they are high. But if the street is comfortable in giving high valuations, then why argue with liquidity. Only thing which an investor can do is to focus on a business where the growth opportunity is big and growth will take care of the valuations. For example, it would be better to focus on a company which is part of the data centers as compared to an FMCG stocks where the growth is going to be single digit or at max low double digit. So, focus on business growth so that valuation comfort is taken care of in another manner.",
