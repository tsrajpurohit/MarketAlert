Among them, 10 stocks have surged over 50%, emerging as key winners to watch in FY26. (Data Source: ACE Equity)",

Why? Because that is how sectoral cycles play out. In such a situation, while it is important to understand the reasons for the headwinds, don\u2019t ignore the fact that some of these sectors have changed structurally, and for good. So, as investors, it is probably time to get these stocks on a watchlist. The reason: Structural improvements are far more important in long-term investing than market sentiment and short-term headwinds. Take the case of engineering and capital goods companies. They faced some issues because of a slowdown in government spending in 2024, and may do so for some more time. A window of opportunity?",
