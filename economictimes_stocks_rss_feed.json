            "description": "As festive lights brighten the markets, six penny stocks have emerged as shining stars, soaring between 35% and 65% in just over two weeks \u2014 from Dussehra to Diwali. This pre-Diwali rally reflects investor optimism, bullish sentiment, and a hunt for value in the microcap space. These top performers were identified using a targeted screening approach that focused on stocks with a market capitalisation below Rs 1,000 crore, a share price under Rs 20, and a recent trading volume of at least 5 lakh shares. This strategy is designed to highlight low-priced, actively traded small-cap stocks demonstrating strong upward momentum. (Data Source: ACE Equity)",
