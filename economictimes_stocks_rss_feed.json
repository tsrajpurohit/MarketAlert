            "description": "Every industry has its silent contributors, firms that power larger systems without seeking the spotlight. This company belongs to that category. Its products rarely carry brand labels, yet they move the mechanisms behind everyday machines. Success is measured not by consumer recall, but by trust within the value chain. Born in the early 1990s during India\u2019s industrial opening, this auto ancillary has quietly navigated three decades of change from foreign collaborations to local capability, from mechanical parts to precision systems. Over time, it moved beyond a single line of business, building parallel verticals to balance cyclicality in the automotive trade. This series on auto ancillary companies works with the assumption that, from the whole set of auto ancillary companies, some multibagger stocks will emerge. And some companies in this space risk going bankrupt.",
