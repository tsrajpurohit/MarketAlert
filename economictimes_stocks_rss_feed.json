Within the Nifty Microcap 250 index, they raised their stakes in 108 stocks in the June quarter compared to the March quarter. It is an important signal, since FIIs usually dive deep before investing.So far in FY26, the Nifty Microcap index has delivered a return of around 16%, outperforming the broader benchmark Nifty index, which has risen by about 6% during the same period. This highlights a growing investor appetite for high-growth opportunities in smaller, lesser-known companies. What makes this trend even more compelling is that out of the 108 microcap stocks where FIIs have increased their holdings, 51 have outperformed the overall microcap index\u2019s return so far this fiscal year. From this list, we have identified 11 remarkable microcap stocks that have delivered impressive price increases ranging from 50% to 100% in FY26 so far. (Data Source: ACE Equity)",

The declines were on selling pressure in energy, IT and bank stocks. The index recovered smartly after a gap-down opening, rising above 24,900, however, the Nifty failed to sustain at higher levels.Commenting on the day\u2019s action, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said that the index continues to trade below the 50 EMA, confirming a bearish trend. \u201cThe RSI is in a bearish crossover. Despite several negative setups, a hidden positive divergence has been observed over the past 2\u20133 days, indicating a potential bullish reversal. This setup may play out well if the Nifty decisively moves above 25,000. On the lower side, support is placed at 24,600. A range-bound movement is expected until the Nifty breaks out of the 24,600\u201325,000 range,\" De said.Here are 2 stock recommendations for Friday:",
