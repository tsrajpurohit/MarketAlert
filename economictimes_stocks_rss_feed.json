            "description": "The stock market is about managing uncertainty, but there are times when this quotient is off the charts. In such times, it is better to use both quantitative and qualitative measures to reduce risk. Because, in equity as an asset class, risk cannot be eliminated. To reduce risk, look at companies with a certain level of RoCE and low debt. Check whether the company pays dividends regularly. Together, these things show the ability of a management to handle adverse business cycles. In our list today there is one company which has not paid dividends. But being in a sector like infrastructure, it is expected that dividends will not come as execution of projects requires a good amount of working capital.",
