While the Sensex marched ahead confidently, gaining 9.5%, the BSE Smallcap Index stumbled, slipping 6.5% over the same period. For smallcap investors, it felt like the music had suddenly stopped. But this short-term pain hides a much bigger story. Rewind the clock. In the previous two calendar years, smallcaps were the undisputed stars of Dalal Street. The BSE Smallcap Index crushed the Sensex with a wide margin\u2014soaring nearly 48% in 2023 and adding another 30% in 2024. Put together, the index has delivered an impressive ~90% return over the last three years.Yet, smallcaps are never a smooth ride. Returns swung sharply from year to year, reminding investors of the segment\u2019s volatile nature. And still, amid this inconsistency, a rare and remarkable group emerged. Twelve smallcap stocks defied the odds. Each of them delivered more than 50% gains in every single year over the last three calendar years. The result? A staggering cumulative rally of 500% to 1,450%. Yes, you read that right\u2014each of these stocks multiplied investors\u2019 wealth by over five times. In a market where indices zigzag, these outliers proved that extraordinary returns are possible\u2014if you manage to spot the right smallcap stories early. (Data Source : ACE Equity)",
