            "description": "India\u2019s headline indices ended with minor gains on Wednesday as gains in FMCG and IT stocks were offset by selling trends in auto and banks. Nifty which ended with 0.14% gains, traded within a narrow range, remaining below the 50 EMA on the daily timeframe. Commenting on the day\u2019s action, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said that the short-term trend remains slightly weak as the index continues to sustain below this critical moving average. \u201cHowever, the possibility of a meaningful recovery stays intact, supported by a bullish reversal pattern formation and a hidden positive divergence. In simple terms, the index may continue to move up towards 25,000\u201325,200 in the short term, with support placed at 24,750. A break below this level could weaken market sentiment,\u201d De said.Here are 4 stock recommendations for Thursday:",

This series on auto ancillary companies works with the assumption that, from the whole set of auto ancillary companies, some multibagger stocks will emerge. And some companies in this space risk going bankrupt.",
