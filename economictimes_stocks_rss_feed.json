The 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex finished at 75,939.18, declining by 28.21 points or 0.04% and the broader Nifty rose by 12.40 points or 0.05% to close at 22,932.90.Commenting on the day's action, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said that Nifty has moved within a band, keeping the volatile vibe intact. \"On the lower end, 22,800 is likely to remain crucial support.

A decisive breakout above 23,150 could induce a significant rally in the market,\" De said.Here are 2 stock recommendations forThursday:",
