They are higher today, even after taking into account the corrections of the past year. The bottom line: If you are careful, you can ensure that you get that extra return for the extra risk taken. Now, why are we talking about this at this juncture? After many months of correction, the last three weeks have seen the bulls make a comeback. As market breadth is also better, the probability of things turning better for the mid-cap segment is higher.",
