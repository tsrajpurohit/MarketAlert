They are higher today, even after taking into account the corrections of the past year. The bottom line: If you are careful, you can ensure that you get that extra return for the extra risk taken. Now, why are we talking about this at this juncture? After many months of correction, the last three weeks have seen the bulls make a comeback. As market breadth is also better, the probability of things turning better for the mid-cap segment is higher.",

In 2008-09, when there was a board-based cut in excise duty and CENVAT, the impact was felt first by the auto sector, especially the entry-level segment. Why? Because autos are classic durable goods, sensitive to both price cuts and perceived income gains. The bottom line: Tax savings, when large enough, can accelerate pent-up aspirational purchases. Now, it is not only about the festive season. We are also getting closer to the point where EVs are becoming common and the winner of the EV segment will soon be decided.
