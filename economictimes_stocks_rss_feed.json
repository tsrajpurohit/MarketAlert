While it is not always the case, sometimes the expiry of a derivative series contract throws light on what might happen in the near term. This time around, it has indicated continued volatility. The task for investors is therefore to reframe volatility not as a threat but as an entry point. Buying into weakness requires patience and conviction, but history tells us that those who take the longer view are rewarded. It means ignoring the noise and focusing on whether the company\u2019s competitive edge, innovation pipeline, or consumer franchise will still matter five or ten years from now. Our selected stocks for today depict a strong upward trajectory in their overall average score which is based on five key pillars: Earnings, fundamentals, relative valuation, risk, and price momentum. This implies that there has been a significant improvement in their market outlook in the given time frame.",
