But look at the market breadth, which was positive even before the spike. Going forward, one eye should always be on market breadth, and that too in the mid-cap segment. Also, the Indian market\u2019s performance must be seen in light of the fact that developed markets are under pressure due to what is happening with the Nasdaq.
