Going forward, 22,400 might continue to act as crucial support, and sentiment is unlikely to weaken unless Nifty falls below this level. On the higher end, resistance is placed at 22,750, above which the bulls might gain increased strength. The overall large-cap sentiment could also strengthen if Nifty moves above 22,750,\" De said.Here are 4 stock recommendations for Tuesday:",

But a deeper look reveals that there are some segments of the sector that are relatively better placed than others. Transmission is one of them. Once a transmission line is built, revenue is stable and it is literally a monopoly business. To put it in perspective: If a transmission line is laid between a plant in Dadri (power producing area) and Rajasthan (power consuming region), there is no scope or need for another line to come up. There are other factors, too, that make the transmission and distribution ecosystem better than others in the power sector.",
