            "description": "Market Expert Dinshaw Irani, in an interview to ET Now, said that FIIs have returned to the Indian market, with inflows of around $3.5\u20134 billion in the last two weeks. This reflects active money coming back, unlike the passive flows seen in ETFs. He sees this as a positive sign, but remains cautious as valuations appear stretched. Earnings reports are showing cuts across various sectors, making Irani cautious. Although fully invested, his approach remains cautious, with a 61-62% net exposure in long-short strategies.",

Yes, the air force is also undertaking exercises, but somehow it is the navy that is visibly more active. Now, all this is a short-term reaction. The long-term reality is that if India is to become an economic super power, it needs much better defence capabilities. And these should not be dependent on foreign countries. Now, defence capabilities cannot be built overnight. So, ignore the short-term events and focus on defence as a long-term trend.",
